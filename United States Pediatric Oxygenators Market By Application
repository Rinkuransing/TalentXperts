Pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) also utilize pediatric oxygenators for various critical care scenarios. These units require devices that can provide reliable oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal for prolonged periods. The market segment for PICU applications is influenced by innovations that focus on miniaturization, portability, and integration with advanced monitoring systems, catering specifically to the needs of critically ill pediatric patients.

In addition to congenital heart disease surgeries, cardiac transplantation, and PICU applications, pediatric oxygenators are also employed in pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO is used as a life-saving intervention in severe respiratory or cardiac failure, providing temporary support to allow the patient's lungs or heart to recover. The market for ECMO applications in pediatrics benefits from advancements in circuit design, oxygenator technology, and anticoagulation strategies, aimed at improving patient outcomes and reducing complications.

Lastly, pediatric oxygenators find application in pediatric cardiac research and development. These devices are crucial in experimental studies and clinical trials aimed at improving treatment protocols and developing innovative therapies for pediatric cardiac conditions. The market segment for research and development applications is driven by collaborations between medical institutions, universities, and device manufacturers to push the boundaries of pediatric cardiac care.
