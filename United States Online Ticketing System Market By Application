Additionally, digital ticketing enhances security by offering QR codes and digital verification methods, mitigating the risks associated with paper tickets.

Finally, online education and e-learning have emerged as a rapidly growing segment for online ticketing systems. Educational institutions and online learning platforms utilize digital ticketing to manage enrollments for courses, webinars, and virtual classes. This approach not only simplifies the enrollment and payment processes for students but also enables institutions to track attendance and participation effectively.
